## leetcode-solutions

This is where I am dumping my solutions to leetcode. I find it easier to use then hackerrank

## How this repo is organized

This repo is organized by the uniqueID name of leetcode program

e.g. fizzbuzz is "412-fizzbuzz.js"

Other implementations in other programming languages such as python would be dubbed "412-leetcode.py"

This makes the solutions very easy to CTRL+F search on the page. 

## Sorting

Github does an A-Z sort for the repos, it might be better to name these items "fizzbuzz-412.js" instead.
This depends mostly on whether or not the names are problem sets are memorable or not. "Fizzbuzz" is, but "461-HammingDistance" is not.


## Folder structs

Folder structures are not relevant here unless its a multipart problem.
